<h3>Website Information</h3>
Teletwitter is a 'joke' app created by Holger Krupp to recreate the joy people had with teletext. No personal data is collected, no data is analized, no tweets are saved.<br />
The usage is mainly limited by the number of request to the twitter API. I haven't been optimizing for it yet.<br />
